## 2. Repository Structure

Below is an overview of how the repository is organized:

```plaintext
├── Assets/             # Art, sounds, music, etc.
├── Docs/               # Project documentation (including this file)
├── Source/             # Game source code
│   ├── Gameplay/       # Game logic and scripts
│   ├── UI/             # User interface elements
│   └── ...  
├── Tests/              # Automated tests
└── README.md           # General project info
```

## 3. Branching Strategy

We will adopt a Gitflow-inspired workflow with the following branches:

main: Contains production-ready code.

develop: Integrates features for the upcoming release.

feature/<JIRA-KEY>: For new features.

bugfix/<JIRA-KEY>: For bug fixes.

release/<version>: Used for release preparation and final testing.

hotfix/<JIRA-KEY>: For critical fixes on main.
For more details on Gitflow, see the Gitflow Workflow.

## 4. Commit Message Standard Using Jira
Our commits must follow a standardized format that references Jira issues.

### 4.1 Commit Message Format

<ISSUE-KEY>: <Brief summary of changes>

[Optional] Detailed description or bullet points:
- Why this change was necessary
- What exactly was changed
- How to test/verify
- 
### 4.2 Examples
Feature Commit Example:

GAME-101: Implement player health regeneration

- Added new health regeneration script under Source/Gameplay
- Modified player stats to include 'healthRegenRate'
- Tested the regeneration with multiple scenarios locally

Bugfix Commit Example:
GAME-202: Fix collision bug in level 3

- Updated collision detection script to handle out-of-bounds enemies
- Confirmed fix using test cases in Tests/CollisionTest
Refactoring / Minor Change

GAME-310: Refactor inventory system for better performance

- Simplified data structures in Inventory.cs
- Removed redundant calls during item equip/unequip operations
  
### 4.3 Commit Description Rules

Mandatory Jira Issue Key: Start every commit message with the Jira issue key (e.g., GAME-123:).

Concise Summary: Provide a brief summary (50–72 characters) of what the commit does.

Detailed Description (Optional): Use bullet points or short paragraphs to explain why and how the changes were made.

Scope: Preferably, each commit should reference one Jira ticket. If multiple tickets must be referenced (not recommended), list them (e.g., GAME-101, GAME-102:).

Grammar & Clarity: Ensure clear, proper grammar and spelling to aid team communication.

## 5. Pull Request & Code Review
Pull Request Guidelines

Title: Should include the Jira issue key and a brief summary.
Example: [GAME-101] Implement player health regeneration

Description: Provide details on what was changed and why. If the Jira ticket is detailed, a brief description with a reference to the ticket is sufficient.

Reviewers: Tag at least one teammate for review.

Approval & Merging: After approval and passing all checks (e.g., tests, linting), merge the feature branch into develop.
## 6. Testing & QA

Unit Tests: Located under the Tests/ folder. Run tests using your preferred test runner (e.g., npm test, pytest, etc.).

Integration Tests: Validate game flow and feature interactions. Document the test steps under Docs/Testing/.

Performance Tests: Use the game engine’s profiler or related tools (e.g., Unity Profiler) to ensure stable FPS and memory usage.
## 7. Definition of Done

A user story or task is considered Done when:

1. The feature is implemented and meets all acceptance criteria in the Jira ticket.
2. Code review is completed with no pending changes.
3. All tests (unit, integration, etc.) have passed successfully.
4. Relevant documentation has been updated.
5. The pull request is merged into develop or main (depending on the release stage).

   
## 8. Project Roadmap
Below is a high-level timeline for future milestones. This roadmap will be updated as the project evolves.
Milestone       Target Date   Features
Alpha Release   YYYY-MM-DD    Basic gameplay loop, core mechanics, simple UI
Beta Release    YYYY-MM-DD    Multiplayer support, final art assets, polish
Full Release    YYYY-MM-DD    Steam/console deployment, final QA, marketing
9. Additional Notes

Communication: Use Jira comments for detailed discussions regarding features or tasks.

Stand-Ups: Optional daily meetings to discuss progress and blockers.

Documentation: Keep all project documentation in the Docs/ folder.
